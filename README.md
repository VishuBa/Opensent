# Opensent

Opensent is a blockchain based solution to implement real world finacial contract. The problem with crypotcurrency is that it is theoretically untraceable by the government. 

The blockchain technology offers huge benefits(such as P2P, security, scalability, robustness, tamper-free, consistency, shared public ledger), which makes it one of the best solution in an environment where shareholders don't trust each other.

Opensent is one such product which implements smart contracts in a financial setting. To new thing is government is one fo the stake holders. So using this platform, let's say you buy a furniture from a shop at Rs. X. The following series of events will occur as per the smart contract: 

- You pay the shopkeeper X+GST. Your wallet gets debited by X+GST Rs.

- Shopkeers's gets X Rs. credited in her wallet.

- The GST is credited to government's wallet abnd X amount credited to 

This is one example. A smart contract in a canteen of an instituion has been written as of now.
